ID: 00723d16 Answer Correct Answer: 0.25, 1/4 Rationale The correct answer is . For an equation in slope-intercept form , represents the slope of the line in the xy- plane defined by this equation. It's given that line 𝓁 is defined by . Subtracting from both sides of this equation yields . Dividing both sides of this equation by yields , or . Thus, 𝓁 the slope of line in the xy-plane is 𝓁 . Since line is perpendicular to line in the xy-plane, the slope of line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line 𝓁. The negative reciprocal of is . Note that 1/4 and .25 are examples of ways to enter
