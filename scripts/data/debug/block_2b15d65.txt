ID: 2b15d65f Answer Correct Answer: A Rationale Choice A is correct. Let the economist's model be the linear function , where Q is the demand, P is the selling price, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line in the xy-plane, where . Two pairs of the selling price P and the demand Q are given. Using the coordinate pairs , two points that satisfy the function are and . The slope m of the function can be found using the formula . Substituting the given values into this formula yields , or . Therefore, . The value of b can be found by substituting one of
