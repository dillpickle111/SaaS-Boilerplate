CHOICES
[
  "pursuing prey.",
  "multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation. more lizard species use, on average, 90%-100% of their maximal speed while escaping predation than use any other",
  "percentage of their maximal speed.",
  "at least 4 lizard species use, on average, less than 100% of their maximal speed while pursuing prey."
