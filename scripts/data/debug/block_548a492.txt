ID: 548a4929 Answer Correct Answer: A Rationale Choice A is correct. The x-intercept of a graph in the xy-plane is the point on the graph where . It's given that function is defined by . Therefore, the equation representing the graph of is . Substituting for in the equation yields . Subtracting from both sides of this equation yields . Dividing both sides of this equation by yields . Therefore, the x-intercept of the graph of in the xy-plane is . It's given that the x-intercept of the graph of is . Therefore, . The y-intercept of a graph in the xy-plane is the point on the graph where . Substi
