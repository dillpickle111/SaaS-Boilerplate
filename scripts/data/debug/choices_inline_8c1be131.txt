ID: 8c1be131 During the World War II era, some Mexican American women adopted a striking new look called pachuca style. They wore altered men's jackets or zoot suits (wide-legged, long-coated suits) and dramatic makeup, and they combed their hair into high, rounded shapes. Some people criticized pachuca style, saying it was dangerous and women should dress traditionally. But historians see things differently. They see pachuca style as a form of rebellion against the era's rigid social expectations for women. They say that it showed a desire for self-expression and freedom on the part of women
