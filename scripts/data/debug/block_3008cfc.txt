ID: 3008cfc3 Answer Correct Answer: 33 Rationale The correct answer is . It's given in the table that the coordinates of two points on a line in the xy-plane are and . The y-intercept is another point on the line. The slope computed using any pair of points from the line will be the same. The slope of a line, , between any two points, and , on the line can be calculated using the slope formula, . It follows that the slope of the line with the given points from the table, and , is , which is equivalent to , or . It's given that the y-intercept of the line is . Substituting for and the coordinat
