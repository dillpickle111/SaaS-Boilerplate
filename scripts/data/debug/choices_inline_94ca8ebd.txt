Which statement, if true, would most directly support the student's claim? The text of the poem as published in the quarterly journal is not identical to the text of the poem publi

CHOICES

  "interesting as a result. The publishers of the stand-alone volume requested the explanatory notes from the poet in order to make the book",

  "drafts."
