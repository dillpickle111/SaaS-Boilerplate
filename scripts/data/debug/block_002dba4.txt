ID: 002dba45 Answer Correct Answer: .1764, .1765, 3/17 Rationale The correct answer is . It's given that line is perpendicular to line in the xy-plane. This means that the slope of line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line . The equation of line , , is written in slope-intercept form , where is the slope of the line and is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line. It follows that the slope of line is . The negative reciprocal of a number is divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of is , or . Thus, the slope of line is . Note that 3/17, .1764, .1765, and 0.1
