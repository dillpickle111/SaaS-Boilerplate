CHOICES
[
  "easier to collect from the beach than to harvest from the seafloor. the highest number of tools were at a depth of 3-4 meters below the surface, which suggests that the Neanderthal",
  "population at the site was highest during the related period of time. at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the numbers of tools of each type suggests that",
  "Neanderthals preferred to use clamshells from the beach because of their durability. the higher number of tools at depths of 5-6 meters below the surface in the cave than at depths of 4-5 meters below",
  "the surface suggests that the size of clam populations changed over time."
