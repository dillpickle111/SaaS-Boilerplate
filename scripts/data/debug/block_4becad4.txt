ID: 4becad44 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is correct. A system of two linear equations in two variables, and , has no solution when the lines in the xy-plane representing the equations are parallel and distinct. Two lines are parallel and distinct if their slopes are the same and their y-intercepts are different. The slope of the graph of the given equation, , in the xy-plane can be found by rewriting the equation in the form , where is the slope of the graph and is the y-intercept. Adding to each side of the given equation yields . Dividing each side of this equation by yields
