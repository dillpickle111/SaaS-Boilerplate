ID: ff501705 Answer Correct Answer: 6 Rationale The correct answer is . A system of two linear equations in two variables, and , has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, and , are parallel if the coefficients for and in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning ; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning is not equal to or . The first equation in the given system is . Multiplying each side of this equat
