It's given that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: the inequality represents this situation. It's also given that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages: the inequality represents this situation. Values of a and b that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and 100-pound packages the helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, a, in the helicopter, the number of 100-pound packages, b, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing b in terms of a in the second inequality yields , so the minimum value of b is equal to . Substituting for b in the first inequality results in . Using the distributive property to rewrite this inequality yields , or . Subtracting 1,000 from both sides of this inequality yields . Dividing both sides of this inequality by 20 results in . This means that the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may result from incorrectly creating or solving the system of inequalities. Question Difficulty: Medium",

During the 5-hour period, the auger removed corn from the bin at a constant rate of bushels per hour. Assuming the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, after x hours it will have removed 930x bushels of corn. Because the bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector started using the auger, the equation 24,000 - 930x = 12,840 can be used to find the number of hours, x, Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the bin. Subtracting 12,840 from both sides of this equation and adding 930x to both sides of the equation yields 11,160 = 930x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 930 yields x = 12. Therefore, Hector will have been using the auger for 12 hours when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the storage bin. Choice A is incorrect. Three hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 - 3(930) = 21,210 bushels of corn remained, not 12,840. Choice B is incorrect. Seven hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 - 7(930) = 17,490 bushels of corn will remain, not 12,840. Choice C is incorrect. Eight hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 - 8(930) = 16,560 bushels of corn will remain, not 12,840. Question Difficulty: Hard",

Let the economist's model be the linear function , where Q is the demand, P is the selling price, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line in the xy-plane, where . Two pairs of the selling price P and the demand Q are given. Using the coordinate pairs , two points that satisfy the function are and . The slope m of the function can be found using the formula . Substituting the given values into this formula yields , or . Therefore, . The value of b can be found by substituting one of the points into the function. Substituting the values of P and Q from the point yields , or . Adding 10,000 to both sides of this equation yields . Therefore, the linear function the economist used as the model is . Substituting 55 for P yields . It follows that when the selling price is $55 per unit, the demand is 16,250 units.

    "stem": "ID: f1bfbed3 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues' count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri's count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms' morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms' structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers' decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and co",

The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be \"overstated,\" as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the \"artistic merit\" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never suggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought-if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought.

According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and \"a door to nowhere.\" The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits to this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building's residents. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn't address how long someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it doesn't suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment. Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa's apartment building design may be beneficial, but the text doesn't indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists.

Scholars thought his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson's large collection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have access to that collection. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text tells us that \"Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection,\" but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so.

The text first describes the distinctive pachuca style of dress adopted by some Mexican American women during World War II, saying that some criticized it and asserted that women should dress traditionally. The text then goes on to contrast this position with that of historians, who \"see things differently\": according to these historians, the pachuca style showed a wish for freedom and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women at the time. Therefore, according to the text, historians think that the pachuca style was a way for Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict social expectations. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly describes the pachuca style as a distinctive look adopted during the World War II era. It does not indicate that the pachuca style influences fashion in the United States in the present day. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not indicate that Mexican American women wore the pachuca style to show support for the United States during World War II; rather, the style was a means of self-expression and rebellion against social expectations. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not compare the pachuca style to other fashion trends: the pachuca style is the only style mentioned. Question Difficulty: Medium",

    "stem": "ID: 92c2564d Answer Correct Answer: A Rationale Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation that is directly stated in the text for why ecologists are worried about Pando. The text states that Pando is a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that represents one of the largest organisms on Earth. According to the text, ecologists are worried that Pando's growth is declining, partly because animals are feeding on the trees. In other words, the ecologists are worried that Pando isn't growing at the same rate it used to. Choice B is incorrect. Rather than indicating that Pando isn't producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is indeed producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando's young trees, not that Pando itself can't grow in new areas because it's blocked by fences. Choice D is incorrect because the text offers no evidence that Pando's root system is incapable of supporting new trees or is otherwise a cause of worry for ecologists. Question Difficulty: Medium",

If the LINE transposon found in octopuses is active in a similar part of their brain, that would suggest that LINE transposons support complex cognition in octopuses too, which in turn supports the hypothesis that LINE transposons are linked to advanced cognition in general.

    "stem": "ID: 458b4a11 Answer Correct Answer: C Rationale Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the finding about the microorganism community composition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Kaštovská and her team in which they collected plant- soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Kaštovská and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn't have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what's important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn't change-that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn't address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.

Choice B is incorrect because it isn't supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings, it doesn't indicate that she's excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn't supported by the text: there's no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her mother is a bad role model.

    "stem": "ID: 1ba5ad7a Answer Correct Answer: A Rationale Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative's content) and syuzhet (a narrative's arrangement and presentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the film The Godfather Part II. The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can't fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives. Choice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn't address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the film only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The film's storytelling methods aren't the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part II, whose narrative doesn't adhere to a single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative's content) and syuzhet (a narrative's arrangement and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn't the structure of this film or of other narratives that are told out of chronological order; moreover, the",

The graph presents values for economic policy uncertainty in tax and public spending policy, trade policy, and general economic policy in the UK from 2005 to 2010. The graph shows that in 2005, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 90) was substantially lower than the value for uncertainty about trade policy specifically (approximately 160). It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120) was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that the level of general economic policy uncertainty was similar to the level of uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in both 2005 (with values of approximately 90 and 100, respectively) and 2009 (with values of approximately 80 and 75, respectively). Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty was higher than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2006, 2007, and 2009, not that it was lower each year from 2005 to 2010. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty reached its highest level in 2010, which was when uncertainty about tax and public spending policy also reached its highest level, not its lowest level.

The text explains that transgenic fish have DNA that includes genetic material from other species, that some transgenic fish have genes from jellyfish that make them glow in the dark, and that glow-in-the-dark transgenic fish can now be found in the wild in Brazilian creeks. The quotation indicates why the escape of these fish may have negative long-term ecological effects: glow-in-the- dark transgenic fish might introduce fluorescence into wild fish populations by breeding with wild fish, causing wild fish to glow in the dark and thereby allowing predators to prey on them much more easily. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn't mention any negative effects of the introduction of fluorescent transgenic fish into the wild. The quotation merely compares the ratio of females to males at two sites in the wild where transgenic fish have been observed. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn't support the idea that the escape of fluorescent transgenic fish from Brazilian fish farms may have significant negative long-term ecological effects. Rather, the quotation suggests that more research is needed to understand the effects. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation supports the idea that transgenic fish may be present in more ecosystems than has been observed; it doesn't address whether the presence of fluorescent transgenic fish affects these ecosystems.

    "stem": "ID: 1281dfd5 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text's discussion of lizard species' use of maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%-39% of maximal speed, 40%-49% of maximal speed, 50%-59% of maximal speed, 60%-69% of maximal speed, 70%- 79% of maximal speed, 80%-89% of maximal speed, and 90%-100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%-59%, 60%- 69%, 70%-79%, and 80%-89%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation. Choice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn't organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%-100% (8 species total). However, these data don't complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don't complete the text's discussion of lizard species' use of maxi",

The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues' conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees-grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined. Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues' conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues' conclusion tha",

    "stem": "ID: 98d0a5d7 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion that an observable pattern in time references in novels reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting-which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light-many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers' conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting. Choice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers' conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers' conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by t",

    "stem": "ID: ca5a3fb4 Answer Correct Answer: A Rationale Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the potential effects of logging on forest conservation. The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn't been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way. Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with findings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging.

    "stem": "ID: cf956802 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is the best answer because it presents the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines. The text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more efficiently, or in less time than he could when sewing by hand. It's reasonable to conclude that if New hadn't reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New's bags before he started using sewing machines. Rather than allowing New to generate more interest in his bags, sewing machines helped New keep up with the interest that had already grown. Question Difficulty: Easy",

    "stem": "ID: 403fb4e4 Answer Correct Answer: C Rationale Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the example of Eludoyin and his colleagues' findings concerning female farmers in some regions of Ondo State, Nigeria. The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplifies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specific types of crops in some regions. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%, respectively). Additionally, it doesn't effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don't make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly cultivate cereals, which doesn't address the value for that proportion and thus doesn't show that a majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating certain crops are female.

    "stem": "ID: 95388117 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the comparison of how Colobanthus quitensis benefited from warming temperatures with how Deschampsia antarctica benefited from them. The table shows the land area covered by these two plant species at a site in Antarctica. According to the table, Colobanthus quitensis increased the area it covered by 55% from 2009 to 2018, whereas Deschampsia antarctica increased the area it covered by 28% during the same period. It therefore follows that Colobanthus quitensis saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did and that Colobanthus quitensis increased the area of land it covered by more than half. Choice A is incorrect because according to the table, Deschampsia antarctica covered 1,230 square meters of land in 2009 and 1,576 square meters of land in 2018. Deschampsia antarctica therefore covered a larger, not a smaller, area of land in 2018 than in 2009. Moreover, there's no information in the text or the table that suggests that one species of the plant suppressed the other. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the table. The table shows the land area covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to 2018, not the average size of individual plants belonging to the two species. The data in the table therefore can't be used to make a comparison of the increase in individual plants' average size. Choice D is incorrect because the table shows the land area covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to 2018, not the rate at which the species increased the area they covered. Moreover, there's nothing in the table or the text that suggests that the areas covered by the two species were newly freed from ice. Question Difficulty: Med",

    "stem": "ID: 3091f805 Answer Correct Answer: B Rationale Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Garza and Robles's hypothesis that a layer of fresh water forms a barrier to ochre sea stars. The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels. Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don't cross. To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles's hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and Robles's hypothesis. Such a finding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is incorrect because finding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles's hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn't a barrier to the sea stars. Choice D is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank but sea stars in the other tank climbed into the layer of fresh water wouldn't support Garza and Robles's hypothesis. Instead, such a finding would suggest that the layer of fresh water wasn't a barrier to the sea stars, thereby weakening Garza and Robles's hypothesis. Question Diffic",

In the text, the arts journalist asserts that Enwezor wished not just to focus on modern African artists but also to show \"how their work fits into the larger context of global modern art and art history,\" or how their work relates to artistic developments and work by other artists elsewhere in the world. The description of Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945-1965 indicates that Enwezor and Siegel's exhibition brought works by African artists together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist's claim that Enwezor sought to show works by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history. Choice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn't support the arts journalist's claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists fit into the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale indicates that the retrospective focused only on the work of a single African artist, El Anatsui. The description doesn't suggest that the exhibition showed how El Anatsui's works fit into a global artistic context.
