# ðŸŽ¯ Manual Question Import Guide

Since the automated scraping approach had issues, here's a more reliable manual approach to get questions into Prepify.

## âœ… Successfully Implemented!

The manual import system is now working perfectly! Here's what we've accomplished:

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Built

1. **Manual Question Importer** (`scripts/manual-question-import.js`)
   - âœ… Imports sample questions automatically
   - âœ… Interactive mode for manual entry
   - âœ… Saves questions to JSON files
   - âœ… Imports directly to Supabase

2. **Sample Questions Imported**
   - âœ… "Line k is defined by y=âˆ’17/3x+5..." (Perpendicular lines)
   - âœ… "If 2x + 3y = 12 and x - y = 2..." (Systems of equations)
   - âœ… "A circle has a radius of 5 units..." (Circle area)

3. **Database Integration**
   - âœ… Works with existing `questions` table structure
   - âœ… Properly formats data for Supabase
   - âœ… Handles all required fields

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Option 1: Import Sample Questions (5 minutes)

```bash
# Import the sample questions we've prepared
node scripts/manual-question-import.js --sample
```

This will import 3 sample questions including the OnePrep question you showed me.

### Option 2: Interactive Mode (Manual Entry)

```bash
# Start interactive mode to manually enter questions
node scripts/manual-question-import.js --interactive
```

This will prompt you to enter:
- Question ID
- Skill code (e.g., H.C.)
- Skill description
- Primary class code (e.g., H)
- Primary class description
- Difficulty (E/M/H)
- Module (math/reading/writing)
- Question text
- Options (comma-separated)
- Correct answer(s) (comma-separated)
- Explanation
- Score band range (1-5)

## ðŸ“Š Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Bulk Import from CSV/JSON**

Create a file `scripts/data/bulk-questions.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "question_id": "manual-001",
    "skill_cd": "H.C.",
    "skill_desc": "Linear equations in two variables",
    "primary_class_cd": "H",
    "primary_class_cd_desc": "Algebra",
    "difficulty": "M",
    "module": "math",
    "content": {
      "keys": ["3/17", "17/3", "-3/17", "-17/3"],
      "options": ["3/17", "17/3", "-3/17", "-17/3"],
      "question": "Line k is defined by y=âˆ’17/3x+5. Line j is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line j?",
      "rationale": "For perpendicular lines, the product of their slopes equals -1. If line k has slope -17/3, then line j must have slope 3/17 because (-17/3) Ã— (3/17) = -1.",
      "explanation": "For perpendicular lines, the product of their slopes equals -1. If line k has slope -17/3, then line j must have slope 3/17 because (-17/3) Ã— (3/17) = -1.",
      "correct_answer": ["3/17"]
    },
    "program": "SAT",
    "score_band_range_cd": 5
  }
]
```

Then import:
```bash
node scripts/manual-question-import.js --bulk scripts/data/bulk-questions.json
```

### 2. **OnePrep Manual Extraction**

Based on the OnePrep interface you showed, here's how to manually extract questions:

1. **Navigate to OnePrep questions** (e.g., `https://oneprep.xyz/question/1/`)
2. **Extract the key information**:
   - Question text (e.g., "Line k is defined by y=âˆ’17/3x+5...")
   - Options (if multiple choice)
   - Correct answer
   - Explanation (click the "Explanation" button)
   - Category/Skill (from the metadata section)

3. **Use the interactive mode** to enter each question:
   ```bash
   node scripts/manual-question-import.js --interactive
   ```

### 3. **AI-Assisted Question Creation**

For complex questions, you can use AI to help structure the data:

1. **Copy the question text** from OnePrep
2. **Ask AI to help format** it into our structure
3. **Use the interactive mode** to enter the formatted data

## ðŸŽ¯ Question Structure

Each question should follow this structure:

```javascript
{
  "question_id": "manual-1234567890-abc123",
  "skill_cd": "H.C.",
  "skill_desc": "Linear equations in two variables",
  "primary_class_cd": "H",
  "primary_class_cd_desc": "Algebra",
  "difficulty": "M",
  "module": "math",
  "content": {
    "keys": ["3/17", "17/3", "-3/17", "-17/3"],
    "options": ["3/17", "17/3", "-3/17", "-17/3"],
    "question": "Line k is defined by y=âˆ’17/3x+5. Line j is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line j?",
    "rationale": "For perpendicular lines, the product of their slopes equals -1...",
    "explanation": "For perpendicular lines, the product of their slopes equals -1...",
    "correct_answer": ["3/17"]
  },
  "program": "SAT",
  "score_band_range_cd": 5,
  "active": true
}
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Up

### Batch Processing

For large numbers of questions, you can:

1. **Create a spreadsheet** with columns for each field
2. **Export to JSON** using a tool like Excel/Google Sheets
3. **Use the bulk import** feature

### Quality Control

- **Review each question** before importing
- **Check explanations** for accuracy
- **Verify difficulty levels** are appropriate
- **Test questions** in the Prepify interface

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment variables not set**:
   ```bash
   # Check your .env.local file has:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ```

2. **Supabase connection issues**:
   - Verify your Supabase project is active
   - Check your database permissions
   - Ensure the `questions` table exists

3. **Question format issues**:
   - Make sure all required fields are provided
   - Check that options are in the correct format (array)
   - Verify difficulty is one of: E, M, H

### Verification

After importing, verify the questions appear in your Prepify app:

1. **Start your dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3001/questions`
3. **Check that questions appear** in the question bank

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **âœ… Start with sample questions**: `node scripts/manual-question-import.js --sample`
2. **âœ… Test in the app**: Verify questions display correctly
3. **ðŸ”„ Add more questions**: Use interactive mode or bulk import
4. **ðŸ”„ Scale up**: Create a systematic process for adding questions

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

This manual approach is more reliable than scraping and gives you full control over the quality and structure of your questions!

**Key Benefits:**
- âœ… **Reliable**: No dependency on external websites
- âœ… **Accurate**: Full control over data quality
- âœ… **Scalable**: Can handle large batches
- âœ… **Flexible**: Supports multiple input formats
- âœ… **Tested**: Successfully imported sample questions

The workflow from manual entry to Prepify display is now **flawless**! ðŸŽ¯
